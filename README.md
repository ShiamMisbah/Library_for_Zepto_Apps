This is a library website to view and bookmark different books from a given library API.

The index page shows a number of books (limited to 32 per page), from where the user can bookmark any book of their liking and view them at a different page. 

From the index library the user can go to two different pages, the wishlist page and the book details page. 

The wishlist page is navigated through the navbar (located ad the top of the page).  This page contains the books that the user have wishlisted. 

Wishlisting or removing book from the wishlist books can be performed from any of the three pages available and in real time.

From the index page if we click on any book, it will take the user to a new page which contains the details of the clicked book. A user can wishlist the book from this page also.

The whole project is made in a simple and user friendly manner, with clean code practice. 

I hope this website will be pleasing to the eye and to use.

ENJOY !!!
